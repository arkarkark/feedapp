My full suspension is running the original groupset it came with (a mix of lx/xt that are ~5 years old) and tuning it is becoming a pain.

I've been looking at the X9 2x10 but it appears Shimano has some 2x10 groups as well.

Any thoughts/comments?  In all likelihood, this will end up being a wheel/groupset upgrade since the LX hubs have the disk (for the disc brake) grometed to the hub.

Thoughts/insights?

Thanks
